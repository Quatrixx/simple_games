# Simple Games

### longdle

A version of [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/) which supports custom word length (not just 5 letters), rendered in simple pygame graphics.  
Uses the [3000 most common English words](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/) as possible goal words and accepts [466k English words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) as guesses.
